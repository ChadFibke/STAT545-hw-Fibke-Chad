# 1.Installation of data set and data analysis packages 

```{r}
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)
library(forcats)

```
Just some quick notes:

+ Comments about my code will bewithin code chunks:
```{r}
# Like this 
```
+ Comments about my workflow will be outside of the code chunks. 
+ I will be working with the gapminder dataset!

# 2.Factor management 
Let's take a look at gapminder to see what variables are concidered factors:
```{r}
str(gapminder)
```

Now we know gapminder's variable:

+ Country is a factor and  has 142 different levels.

```{r}
levels(gapminder$country) %>% 
  head() %>% 
  knitr::kable(col.names = "Country Factors")
  # I'm only showing few levels to help our poor eyes
```

+ Continent is a factor and has 5 different levels. 
```{r}
levels(gapminder$continent) %>% 
  knitr::kable( col.names = "Continent Factors")

```
