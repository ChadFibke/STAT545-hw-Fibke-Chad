## STAT545-hw01-An Introduction to github

Hey everyone, my name is Chad Fibke and I've just started a MSc in *Population & Public Health* working under [Dr.Amee Manges](http://spph.ubc.ca/person/amee-manges/)! We are working on **Poop enemas** and how they can prevent infections! **All of these fancy words were added using R-studio**.

When I'm not wrking with poop enemas I like to:
  + Bike
  + Run
  + Paintball
  + Swing-dance 
  
### GitHub Workflow & RMarkdown Experience 

#### GitHub Workflow
  + The README.md will introduce who I am 
  + The file hw01_gapminder_files/figure-markdown_github-ascii_identifiers/ will show you the plots I made!
  + The file named hw01_gapminder.md, ~~not hw01_gapminder.Rmd~~, will include a quick exploration of the gapminder data. It will show you the steps I take when loading a new data set! 
  
  
#### RMarkdown Experience 
  + I had problems with adding color to each code chunk. I think adding color would help with the flow.
  + I used the [This site](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) to get some more information on the idea behind Rmarkdown
  + I tried using [This site](https://yihui.name/knitr/options/), but it was intimidating!

#### Quick links to my homework:

+ [HW02.md](https://github.com/ChadFibke/STAT545-hw02-Fibke-Chad/blob/master/hw02.md) is where I take you on a coding adventure through the assignment.
+ And [Over here](https://github.com/ChadFibke/STAT545-hw02-Fibke-Chad/tree/master/hw02_files/figure-markdown_github-ascii_identifiers) is where you can find my graphs!

I had problems trying to pick a problem to look at in depth! Once I found an issue to look at a lot of the filtering was an issue. There was a lot of objects building up in my work environment, so at times I found myself calling on the wrong object (I thought R knew what I was thinking!). I also wanted to make some adjustments to the graph outside of the points so I had to do some googling! 

I used a lot of resources for ggplots! There is:

+ [One](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-themes-and-background-colors-the-3-elements) that will allow you to customize your background.
+ [Two](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html) is a good place for labels, scales, and any other need you may have!
